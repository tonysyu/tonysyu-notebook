The shortlist

- General Coding: [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1455681555&sr=8-2&keywords=clean+coder) and [Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455681575&sr=8-1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer)
- Python Idioms: [Python Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-Third-David-Beazley/dp/1449340377/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455681599&sr=8-1&keywords=python+cookbook)
- Design Patterns: [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)
- Architecture: [Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455681630&sr=8-1&keywords=domain+driven+design) and [Implementing Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493257769)

The overall list is ordered from small scale to large scale, where the small scale stuff is applicable to all coding (variable names, well-written function etc.). The last one is really specific to larger applications and is probably only interesting for very large applications. If you're not doing python, then there are probably similar books that go over the idioms for your language.

I reluctantly list the [Design Pattens](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493257456&sr=8-1&keywords=design+patterns) book by the Gang of Four because it's not the most enjoyable read (though the material is still solid). You might have better luck on that front with [these python design pattern examples](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns), although that's missing context and discussion about use cases.
